# DotnetCoreCRUDAPI
Hi All, I have just checked-in the CRUD API made in DotNetCore 6.0 for the begineers. In this API I tried to cover basic concepts for those who just started their careers as Dotnet Backend Developers.
## Following are the main things to know as a fresher to make things simple and it will be easy for you guys to continue without messing up the things.
- **CRUD CORE6.0 API **
	- Language: C#
	- Make a Web API having an empty controller
	- Write your Post, Get, Put, Delete Methods in that Controller
	- Make a repository and connect it with database to entertain data
	- Through your Controller's methods call repository layer to manipulate data and write business logics
	- Specify return types and return your data as an output
  - Make use of Interfaces and Classes in elegent manners
